## Getting Started
Take a look at [number_repr.py](https://github.com/BradMcDanel/cps242-assignments/blob/main/number_repr/number_repr.py) to see all of the functions that you will need to implement for this assignment. In the write-up, I broke it down into 3 parts: decimal to binary, binary addition, and binary to decimal. However, you are free to work through these functions in any order that you like.

## Running Tests
I strongly encourage you to actively run the test suite as you are working through the assignment. You can run at any time using:
`python test_number_repr.py`. Note that the test suite requires python3 to run. Running this on the initial skeleton code will result in the first test to fail (and no subsequent tests to run). If you want to change the order of tests (or not run some tests), you can modify the list of tests [here](https://github.com/BradMcDanel/cps242-assignments/blob/main/number_repr/test_number_repr.py#L183). I suggest simply commenting out the tests you don't want to run.

For full credit, your implementation should pass all of the tests. If you believe that one of the tests has an error, please email me the details!
