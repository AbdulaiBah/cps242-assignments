## Getting Started
- Take a look at [simulator.py](https://github.com/BradMcDanel/cps242-assignments/blob/main/02-simulator/simulator.py) to see all of the functions that you will need to implement for this assignment.
- Run tests via `python3 test_simulator.py`. All tests should be passing for full credit.
- The final two tests ([see here](https://github.com/BradMcDanel/cps242-assignments/blob/main/02-simulator/test_simulator.py#L161)) require you to implement yourself. Have fun writing some logic gates!
